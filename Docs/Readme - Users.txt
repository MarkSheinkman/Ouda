Hello users! in this file im gonna tell you how to use Ouda.

Ouda is mainly a data entry protram. You use it to save the data we collect on the public health project, so that we can later get statistical analisys and whatever. im drunk. So the main thing the program does is data input.

You know that book George or Ananbe are using to write people's measurements (no spellchecker, please excuse me) at the end? that's what we're here to replace.

When you start the app, you need to select the location for today. You  can select an earlier location or enter a new one. All entries you make in that session will have that location assosiated with them. If 2 hours pass and you dont enter any new data, the app assumes you just left it running until next day, so next time you tryu to enter a person's data it will ask you for the location again.

The workflow is built to be as quick and easy as possible: you type in a value, press ENTER, type in the next value, ENTER, etc. After the Comment field, when you press ENTER you get to the NEXT button. pressing ENTER here will cause the current data to be saved to the disk and cleared from the app. Now you can enter the data for the next person. You know the data was successfully saved if it's cleared form the app, once that happens you can be 100% sure it's written down on the hard drive.

The other thing the app does is create spreadsheets. You can generate a CSV file from all the data collected so far, and open it in Excel or any other similar program to build graphs and statistical data and other cool stuff. To do that, go to File-> Generate Spreadsheet. You can filter by locations and times.

E-health integration will come at a latter time. there's still a lot of red tape to get over before we can do that. But I (and maybe other developers, maybe ever you) am working on it.

That's it! have a good bloody day.
